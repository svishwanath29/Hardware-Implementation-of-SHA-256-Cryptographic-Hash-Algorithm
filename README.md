# Hardware-Implementation-of-SHA-256-Cryptographic-Hash-Algorithm
This project implements a SHA-256 hardware core using Verilog HDL for secure hashing. It processes 512-bit input blocks to generate 256-bit outputs using an FSM-based iterative architecture. Verified in QuestaSim, the design offers efficient, low-area and reliable performance for FPGA/ASIC security applications.
